# Regu

Regu is a fun experiment to see if it's viable to make fast, limited-power regular expressions for Ruby backed by DFAs.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'regu'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install regu

## Usage

I really don't recommend using it yet, it's very much broken and un-tested. If you want to help, add some specs, fix some bugs, have a good time.

## Contributing

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request
